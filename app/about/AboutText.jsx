          Thank you so much for visiting. This app is a product of my love for
          the city of Orlando, and the art that I've encountered here at home,
          and on my travels. i wanted to create a space where people could share
          their love for the street art that they come across. I hope you enjoy
          using this app as much as I enjoyed creating it.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the future, I plan to add more features to this app, such as a map
          view of the murals, a search function, and a way to filter murals by
          location. I want to make this app a comprehensive resource for street
          art lovers everywhere.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have any suggestions for features that you would like to see
          added, please let me know through my contact form. I am always looking
          for ways to improve this app and make it more useful for everyone.
